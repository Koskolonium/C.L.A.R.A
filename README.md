## Packet Validation  
Packet validation forms the core of C.L.A.R.A’s functionality. It intercepts and inspects player packets to ensure their contents align with expected standards, protecting the server against malicious activity.  

### Player Connections  
As part of packet validation, C.L.A.R.A performs lightweight checks when players connect to the server. This process verifies that usernames and UUIDs follow Minecraft's formats, providing an initial safeguard against fake packets while imposing minimal performance costs.

## Lightweight Checks  
Leveraging the data gathered during packet validation, C.L.A.R.A executes highly accurate lightweight checks to identify anomalies with reduced false positives.  

- **Speed Detection:** Capable of identifying even subtle speed variations, such as changes of 2.5%, based on player activity.  
- **Future Enhancements:** Advanced ReachChecks are in development and will be added in upcoming releases.  

These checks are designed to balance precision and performance, ensuring effective cheat detection without overburdening server resources.

## AI Validation  
C.L.A.R.A’s AI Validation represents the cornerstone of its advanced cheat detection capabilities. Periodically, C.L.A.R.A sends player data—including ping, packet data, and stat modifiers—to a privately hosted AI model for detailed analysis.  

### Anomaly Detection  
The AI model specializes in identifying anomalies, focusing on two of the most challenging aspects of anti-cheat systems: **Player Movement** and **Aim Management**. For example:  
- During combat scenarios, C.L.A.R.A collects and evaluates data on both the player and their opponent to detect irregularities.  
- Through continuous monitoring, it detects patterns that traditional anti-cheat systems may overlook, ensuring a fair gameplay environment.  

### Monetization Strategy  
This powerful AI-driven feature is also key to C.L.A.R.A's monetization strategy. While C.L.A.R.A offers robust free features, certain advanced functionalities of the AI model may be available exclusively through a premium plan upon release.
