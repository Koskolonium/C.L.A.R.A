# Everything You Need to Know About C.L.A.R.A  

## Section 1: Players Connecting  
When players connect to the server, C.L.A.R.A runs lightweight checks to ensure their name and UUID follow Minecraft's formats. This adds an extra layer of protection against malicious fake packets, although it may have limited impact for most servers due to its minimal performance cost.

## Section 2: Packet Validation  
C.L.A.R.A's core functionality revolves around intercepting and analyzing packets to verify their contents. This lightweight approach effectively detects many cheaters with minimal resource usage. Additional enhancements are planned for the future.    

## Section 3: Lightweight Checks  
C.L.A.R.A uses data collected from packets to perform lightweight checks designed to be highly accurate, minimizing false flags. For example, it can detect speed variations as small as 102.5%, depending on player activity. Additionally, two state-of-the-art ReachChecks are planned, although they have not yet been implemented into the Beta Build.
